# Flixtor Scrobbler for Trakt
*By Matheos Mattsson*

Flixtor Scrobbler for trakt is a chrome extension which allows you to automatically scrobble your Flixtor.to activity to your Trakt.tv account.

The plan is to put the extension in the Chrome web store in the future when I feel like I can afford the fee :P. Until then, if you want to try it out, simply clone the repo and unzip it into a folder, enable developer mode in chrome and *load unpacked* in the chrome extensions menu.
